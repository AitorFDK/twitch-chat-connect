# twitch-chat-connect
A super basic client to connect to your Twitch chat fast and easily.

## Configuration
### How to get your twitch token.

You can get it by logging in with your twitch account here https://twitchapps.com/tmi/

It's recommended to use a second account (not the main one).

### Example of config.json

{
	"username": "<your_username",
	"userToken": "<oauth:your_token_here>",
	"channelName": "<your_channel_name>"
}

The username should be the same used to get the user token.
